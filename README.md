# Algorithmic Journey: LeetCode & Beyond

**Author:** Nguyen Quoc Thang
**Email:** nguyenqthangwork@gmail.com

Welcome to my repository! This is where I document my journey of mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) by solving problems on LeetCode and other platforms. My goal is to improve my problem-solving skills, deepen my understanding of algorithms, and prepare for technical interviews.


## What’s Inside?

This repository is organized into the following sections:

*   **LeetCode Daily Challenges:**
*     Solutions to daily problems posted on LeetCode. Perfect for consistent practice!

*   **Codeforces Problemset:**
*     Solutions to problems from Codeforces, focusing on competitive programming techniques.

*   **Algorithmic Patterns:**
*     A collection of common algorithmic patterns and techniques, implemented in multiple languages.

*   **Weekly Contests:**
*     My attempts at solving problems from LeetCode’s weekly contests. A great way to simulate real interview conditions.
